## 👋 Hi Y'all        
I'm Tim, Full Stack Developer 👨‍💻 at INSP TV Network from South Carolina, USA.  I am working to become a remote web developer at an altruistic company where I can use my 10+ years of experience in leadership, guest experience, and process improvement to contribute on a positive and uplifting team. I will use my attention to detail, problem solving skills, and commitment to excellence on a team that trusts their people, allows for flexible hours, and works together to make a lasting difference in the world.
